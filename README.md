I added some simple CSS to try and make it look a little better. 

If you run database.py, the storage database is reset with one student, one quiz and one result.

app.py actually launches the server, which you can add students, quizzes, results, all of that will be instantly stored in database so the data is kept even if you restart the server.

If you want to start again, you just run the first python file.
